Our goal is to build a communication platform that give you peace of mind with end-to-end encryption, without sacrificing quality. Being peer-to-peer, your only limit is your network own connection.",

Breaking it down we wanted a core spec that would define all of the features of our chat app that would work across platforms. And of course the actual implementation of that spec had to be as fast possible. So we chose a low level language, Rust, that happens to also compile across platforms (thanks LLVM!), including the web. Think of Warp as the 'back end' in a world where there are no back ends!",
